### Welcome to my blog!

Hi, my name is Calum and I work as a Senior Software Test Engineer. I created this blog to write about my professional work, hopefully bringing some useful insight into the world of QA.

It's not exclusively about testing though - I am a big fan of tech in general and gaming so other posts will cover those topics too.

If you have any feedback or want to get in touch for any reason, my email and GitHub profile can be found in the footer of any page.

This blog is hosted on GitHub Pages and built using Jekyll. The current theme is Minima:
